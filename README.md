# Image Classifier

This is an example of a convolutional neural network using a 34 layer residual neural network.
This application has been trained to identify if an uploaded image is a tank, a truck, or a plane. 

The training data consited of 200 images of each type of vehicle. 
Further training can be done to help result in lower false identification rates.
